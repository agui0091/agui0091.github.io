  <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

  <p>
    I’m here to share a little about me. My mom gave the name Angela because I was born on October 2<SUp>nd</SUp> , and on this date, my country celebrates <EM> The Day of the guardian angels</EM>. In my heart I just have gratitude for all that I have today. I’m married with an awesome human being, and we have been together for almost twenty years. Now we are parents of a lovely and smart girl called Leonora. She is now a big motivation for being in a new country looking for new and better opportunities.</p>

  <p>Changes bring a lot of challenges, and some fears. However, there are some techniques that help us to deal with these situations. One of them is Meditation <abbr title="Science Of Spirituality">SOS</abbr> , an ancient practice that can bring peace and wisdom to our lives. At home we used to include meditation in our daily basis and this habit brings us joy and harmony.</p>
  

  <blockquote>
   <p> <q> Within us lies the unlimited power and energy of the empowered soul. Its rich qualities include wisdom, fearlessness, immortality, unconditional love, connectedness, and bliss.</q></p>
